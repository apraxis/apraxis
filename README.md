# apraxis

A Clojure FRAMEWORK designed to create fancy dan applications. Fancy dan will be elaborated later.

## Usage

To create a new Apraxis project with the name `my-project`, run:

```bash
lein new apraxis my-project
```

## Templating

Apraxis has templates for

- Client-side components
- Single-page apps

These templates are accessible either through the REPL in the `apraxis.templates` namespace, or as individual leiningen tasks, e.g.:

```clj
(apraxis.templates.component/generate my-component)
```

or

```bash
lein generate component my-component
```

are semantically equivalent.

### Component Generator

The component generator will create four files named after the component specified under four directories. For the component named `my-component`, the files will be:

- `src/client/components/my_component.cljs`
- `src/structure/components/_my_component.haml`
- `src/style/components/_my_component.scss`
- `src/sample/my_component.edn`

### Single-page App Generator

The single-page app generator will create a single full HTML document, and corresponding cljs main file. For the single page app named `my-app`, the files will be:

- `src/client/pages/my_app_main.cljs`
- `src/structure/pages/my_app.haml`

`my_app.haml` will implicitly load `my_app_main.cljs` and execute the `-main` function in that namespace, if `my_app_main.cljs` exists. If `my_app_main.cljs` does not exist, the contents of `my_app.haml` will be presented verbatim as a static web page.

## Incremental Building Pipeline

Apraxis includes an asset pipeline that consumes HAML, SASS, ClojureScript, EDN, and CLJX, and emits JavaScript, CSS, and HTML describing the behavior of a single page client side app. The flow of this pipeline can be visualized as:

    /----------\  /----------\
    |HAML      |->|HTML      |\
    \----------/  \----------/ \
                                \
    /----------\                 \  /----------\
    |CLJS      |------------------->|JavaScript|
    \----------/                 /  \----------/
                                /
    /----------\  /----------\ /
    |CLJX      |->|CLJS      |/
    \----------/  \----------/
    
    /----------\                    /----------\
    |SASS      |------------------->|CSS       |
    \----------/                    \----------/
    
    /----------\  /----------\      /----------\
    |EDN       |->|Apraxis   |----->|JavaScript|
    \----------/  \----------/\     \----------/
                               \
                                \   /----------\
                                 \->|HTML      |
                                    \----------/


HTML, CLJS, and CLJX specify structure and behavior for Om components. SASS specifies styling that controls the visual styling of the component when included in a page, and the Apraxis framework, along with EDN sample data files, generate scaffolding and a layout page for the component to live in. EDN data will be synthesized to a cursor and provided to the component for testing.

## Client Service Integration

Apraxis creates a Pedestal service with tools included for client side integration and API development:

- Datomic DB auto-fetched and associated with requests for data consistency.
- Scaffolding service that builds a containing environment for components to iteratively develop them in isolation.
- Application service that monitors development facilities such as [Figwheel](https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel) and the [CLJS REPL](https://github.com/tomjakubowski/weasel), and configures clients to use them.
- Host matching to initialize client side applications to communicate with an Apraxis service that serves them.

## Testing

When generating a component, tests will be generated that run in <fill in blank browser here later>. The tests will examine the behavior of the component in isolation using the sample data from a behavioral perspective.

When generating a single-page app, tests will be generated that exercise the app in an end-to-end fashion, that is with a running Apraxis service backing the single page app.

## Shipping

`lein jar` will run the entire asset pipeline from all sources, create an executable Apraxis service, and package it as an executable jar. Dependency management will still be on you.

`lein with-profile staging jar` will generate the same jar as above, but with the staging profile. By default, it will not run advance mode compilation when generating the jar to make the generated code more amenable to debugging.

`lein uberjar` will generate a similar jar with an executable Apraxis service, but will also package all dependencies into the produced jar.
