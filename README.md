# apraxis

A Clojure FRAMEWORK designed to create fancy dan applications. Fancy dan will be elaborated later.

## Usage

The hardest place to build is a blank slate.

## Templating

Apraxis has templates for

- Client-side components
- Single-page App

These templates are accessible either through the REPL in the apraxis.templates namespace, or as individual leiningen tasks, e.g.:

```clj
(apraxis.templates.component/generate my-component)
```

or

```bash
lein generate component my-component
```

are semantically equivalent.

### Component Generator

The component generator will create four files named after the component specified under four directories. For the component named my-component, the files will be:

- `src/client/components/my_component.cljs`
- `src/structure/components/_my_component.haml`
- `src/style/components/_my_component.scss`
- `src/sample/my_component.edn`

### Single-page App Generator

The single-page app generator will create a single full HTML document, and corresponding cljs main file. For the single page app named my-app, the files will be:

- `src/client/pages/my_app_main.cljs`
- `src/structure/pages/my_app.haml`

my_app.haml will implicitly load my_app_main.cljs and execute the -main function in that namespace, if my_app_main.cljs exists. If my_app_main.cljs does not exist, the contents of my_app.haml will be presented verbatim as a static web page.

## Incremental Building Pipeline

Apraxis includes an asset pipeline that consumes HAML, SASS, ClojureScript, EDN, and CLJX, and emits javascript, css, and html describing the behavior of a single page client side app. The flow of this pipeline can be visualized as:

    /----------\  /----------\
    |HAML      |->|HTML      |\
    \----------/  \----------/ \
                                \
    /----------\                 \  /----------\
    |CLJS      |------------------->|JavaScript|
    \----------/                 /  \----------/
                                /
    /----------\  /----------\ /
    |CLJX      |->|CLJS      |/
    \----------/  \----------/
    
    /----------\                    /----------\
    |SASS      |------------------->|CSS       |
    \----------/                    \----------/
    
    /----------\  /----------\      /----------\
    |EDN       |->|Apraxis   |----->|JavaScript|
    \----------/  \----------/\     \----------/
                               \
                                \   /----------\
                                 \->|HTML      |
                                    \----------/


HTML, CLJS, and CLJX specify structure and behavior for Om components. SASS specifies styling that controls the visual styling of the component when included in a page, and the Apraxis framework, along with EDN sample data files, generate scaffolding and a layout page for the component to live in. EDN data will be synthesized to a cursor and provided to the component for testing.

## Client Service Integration

Apraxis creates a Pedestal service with tools included for client side integration and API development:

- Datomic DB auto-fetched and associated with requests for data consistency.
- Scaffolding service that builds a containing environment for components to iteratively develop them in isolation.
- Application service that monitors development facilities such as Figwheel and CLJS repls, and configures clients to use them.
- Host matching to initialize client side applications to communicate with an Apraxis service that serves them.
